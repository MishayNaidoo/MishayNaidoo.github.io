			<p>
				Welcome to my ePortfolio! I have created this in an attempt to condense as much important information about myself
				into one, easily accessible spot for you to peruse at your leisure. Currently, my accomplishments mostly revolve around 
				engineering projects, as that is what I am most passionate about, but who knows maybe future me decided he likes pottery
				and this website is full of pictures of clay instead. I hope not...

			<p class="about-text">
				<span> I really hate writing exams.</span>
				<br>
				<br>
				Those where my exact thoughts the day I finished matric back in 2018. However, after taking a one year hiatus from exams while I pursued 
				a degree in 3D animation and game design, I convinced myself that exams weren't so bad after all and enrolled in an engineering degree. 
				Now, almost four years and roughly a <span>trillion</span> exams later I can once again confidently say:
				<br>
				<br>
				<span> I really hate writing exams...</span>
				<br>
				<br>
				Whilst my disdain for exams remains resolute, I have fallen in love with engineering. My lecturers in this degree seemed to have a 
				knack for throwing projects and assignments at me that I felt I was totally incapable of doing and proceeding to tell me to go ahead and do them anyway.
				This in turn, taught me how to approach projects that seemed impossible at the start with a new confidence and belief that I could get them done. With this 
				attitude, I have gone on to pursue and accomplish various projects that this website is here to show off to you. However, my blind confidence 
				hasn't always been enough and there are one of two failed projects. Unfortunately, you'll read about those on here too. 
				<br>
				<br>
				In between all that engineering business, I have developed and furthered a few hobbies. Although I long since decided that a career 
				in the field is not for me, I still enjoy playing video games and watching movies. I have also embraced the Cape Town attitude
				somewhat, and try to keep healthy by going to the gym or, more recently, playing basketball.
				<br>
				<br>
				I hope I've given you some insight into who I am and I encourage you to scroll down and take a look at some of those projects I've worked on.

						<h3>Rowdy Chess V1</h3>
						<p>
							An automated chessboard myself and two friends created, that uses a 3D printed 
							XY plotter to pick up and move chesspieces. This board enabled players to make chess moves 
							using only voice commands.

							currently working on and the tournament is still in progress.

						<h3>Perch Scale</h3>
						<p>
							A smart perch designed to weigh Yellow-Billed Hornbills in their
							natural habitat without causing any distrubances to their environment.
							This was designed to aid researchers at the FitzPatrick institute in 
							their research of the birds. The project used a load cell and ESP32 Cam microcontrollers
							to determine the bird's weight and detect the bird using a camera. The system was also solar powered.

						<h3>Line Following Robot</h3>
						<p>
							This project involved designing a control algorithm that solved a maze using a two wheeled robot.
							The algorithm was created in Matlab Simulink and ran on a microcontroller. We also designed a light colour sensor 
							to determine the colour of a traffic light and were able to make the robot stop moving at a red light and start at a green one.

						<h3>Rocket Versus Asteroid</h3>
						<p>
							This project involved controlling a rocket to collide with an asteroid heading towards earth. 
							The rocket was controlled using various control algortihms to account for different asteroid movement scenarios. This project 
							required the rocket and the asteroid to be modelled before applying a controller to the rocket. It's always
							fun blowing stuff up, even if its just a simulation.

						<h3>Rowdy Chess V2</h3>
						<p>
							This project was a continuation of the Rowdy Chessboard you saw earlier (hence the name). We figured 
							moving chess pieces around with a mechanical arm wasn't cool enough and decided to try make it happen using electromagnets 
							instead. Unfortunately, this proved to be harder than anticipated and the project has been put on hold. We did design a pretty cool Printed Circuit Board that can detect when a piece is on a certain square on the board.
